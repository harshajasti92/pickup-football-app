## ⚽ **Algorithm Core Components**

### **1. Balance Factors & Weights**

**Primary Balancing Factors:**
- **Skill Balance (40%)** - Most important: overall skill distribution
- **Position Balance (25%)** - Essential: proper formation coverage

**Secondary Balancing Factors:**
- **Playing Style Mix (15%)** - Complementary playing styles
- **Age Distribution (10%)** - Mix of age groups

**Tertiary Factors (Future Enhancement):**
- **Historical Performance (5%)** - Recent form
- **Team Chemistry (5%)** - Player compatibility

### **2. Position Requirements Matrix**

**Formation Templates for Different Game Sizes:**

**7v7 Formation:**
- Goalkeeper: 1 required (highest priority)
- Defender: 2-3 players (priority 2)
- Midfielder: 2-3 players (priority 3)
- Forward: 2-3 players (priority 4)

**9v9 Formation:**
- Goalkeeper: 1 required (highest priority)
- Defender: 3-4 players (priority 2)
- Midfielder: 2-4 players (priority 3)
- Forward: 2-3 players (priority 4)

**11v11 Formation:**
- Goalkeeper: 1 required (highest priority)
- Defender: 3-5 players (priority 2)
- Midfielder: 3-5 players (priority 3)
- Forward: 2-4 players (priority 4)

### **3. Playing Style Compatibility Matrix**

**Style Relationships:**

**Aggressive Style:**
- Complements: Technical, Balanced players
- Neutral with: Physical, Creative players
- May clash with: Other Aggressive, Defensive players

**Technical Style:**
- Complements: Physical, Creative, Balanced players
- Neutral with: Aggressive players
- May clash with: Defensive players

**Physical Style:**
- Complements: Technical, Creative players
- Neutral with: Aggressive, Balanced players
- May clash with: Other Physical players

**Note:** Similar compatibility rules apply for Balanced, Creative, and Defensive styles to ensure team chemistry.

## 🔧 **Algorithm Implementation Steps**

### **Step 1: Pre-Processing**
**Player Organization Phase:**
- Sort players by skill level for optimal distribution
- Group players by preferred positions
- Calculate total skill points and target per team
- Determine position requirements based on player count

### **Step 2: Core Balancing Algorithm**
**Four-Phase Team Creation Process:**

**Phase 1: Goalkeeper Distribution (Critical)**
- If 2+ goalkeepers: Place best on different teams
- If 1 goalkeeper: Assign to Team A, find versatile player for Team B
- If no goalkeepers: Find players willing to play in goal

**Phase 2: Snake Draft Distribution**
- Sort remaining players by skill level (highest first)
- Alternate assignment: A, B, B, A, A, B, B, A pattern
- Ensures roughly equal skill distribution

**Phase 3: Position Optimization**
- Check if both teams meet minimum position requirements
- Identify critical position gaps
- Execute strategic swaps to fill gaps

**Phase 4: Final Balance Optimization**
- Calculate current balance score
- Try beneficial player swaps
- Apply improvements that increase overall balance

### **Step 3: Position Optimization**
**Position Gap Analysis:**
- Count players in each position for both teams
- Identify teams lacking critical positions (especially goalkeeper)
- Find best swap candidates to fill position gaps
- Execute swaps that improve position balance without significantly affecting skill balance

### **Step 4: Balance Scoring System**
**Comprehensive Balance Evaluation:**
- Calculate skill balance between teams
- Evaluate position distribution adequacy
- Assess playing style compatibility within teams
- Factor in age distribution balance
- Generate weighted total score (0-100, higher = better balance)

---

## 📊 **Detailed Balance Calculations**

### **Skill Balance (40% weight)**
**Primary Balance Factor:**
- Calculate average skill level for each team
- Measure absolute difference between team averages
- Perfect balance = no difference, score decreases as difference increases
- Maximum reasonable difference threshold: 3 skill points

### **Position Balance (25% weight)**
**Formation Coverage Assessment:**
- Determine appropriate formation template based on team size
- Count players in each position for both teams
- Score based on how well each team meets minimum position requirements
- Higher priority positions (goalkeeper, defender) weighted more heavily

### **Playing Style Balance (15% weight)**
**Team Chemistry Evaluation:**
- Analyze internal team style compatibility for each team
- Check for complementary style pairings within teams
- Identify potential style clashes that might affect team chemistry
- Balance between style diversity and compatibility
